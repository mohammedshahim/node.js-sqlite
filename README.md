# Node.js SQLite Integration

This is a simple Node.js project for integrating SQLite database functionality into your application. With this project, you can quickly set up a Node.js server to interact with an SQLite database using the Sequelize ORM and the Express framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

## To run the server in development mode with automatic code reloading:

```bash
    npm run dev
```

## To start the server in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

## Dependencies

- **Express**:
  A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- **Sequelize**:
  A powerful and flexible ORM for Node.js, supporting various databases, including SQLite.

- **sqlite3**:
  A Node.js module for SQLite3, providing asynchronous, non-blocking SQLite3 bindings for Node.js.

## Development Dependencies

- **Nodemon**:
  A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server.
